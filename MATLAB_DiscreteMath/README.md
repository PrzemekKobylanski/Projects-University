This folder contains task made in MATLAB during discrete matemathic lecture. 
Projekt1 contains basics like permutation generator and searching through graphs using DSF and BSF algorithm
Projekt2 is about practical usage of graphs. It was made in groups and my group used A* algorithm to search optimal way through simple platform level in game

To use and check this projects MATLAB or OCTAVE are required
