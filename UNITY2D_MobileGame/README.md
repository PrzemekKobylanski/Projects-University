This project goal was to create 2D mobile game in UNITY
The MobileGame.apk file is actual game that can be installed at phone with Android system (Android 9 or newer is required). 
Game is about being a spaceship trying to avoid asteroids - the longer player can do it, the higher score is get
The movement is implemented using phone accelerometer - to move player has to tilt a phone, if phone does not have accelerometer or giroscope the game will not work
This folder contains all of the code made in Unity to achieve all game goals.
